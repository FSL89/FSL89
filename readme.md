# Welcome!

## About Me
Self-taught web developer that have been building websites on and off the last 16+ years.

I started with HTML and CSS in the early 2000's and soon after learned basic PHP and MySQL, as I wanted to make my projects more dynamic.
This was long before video tutorials on Youtube, so I have to say that was quite an achievement by today's standards.

These days I mostly work with Javascript in both backend and frontend, but really looking forward in learning other programming languages in the future.


## Current Projects

There are currently no public projects going on, but I am working on a few private projects that may lead to some cool stuff in the future.
