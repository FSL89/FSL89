# Welcome!

## About Me
I'm a guy from Sweden who at an early age knew I like creating things on my computer. 
Originally started off with digital graphics working mostly with raster graphics in Adobe Photoshop, but evolved to more of a web designer and eventually web developer over the years. Self taught in HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL since before Youtube but mostly develop with Javascript these days. Always learning new things and would consider myself a completely self taught coder and web developer, nearing multiple full stack skills.
