# Hi, my name is Fredrik!

Based in Sweden and just really like to build things, especially websites.

### Background

A friend introduced me to HTML in my early teenage years and it to say the least, it blew my mind.
In the mid 2000s (few years later), I finally started self-teaching web development and have been building websites as a hobby since then.

### Present

I'm currently employed as a frontend developer working on different website projects for other companies, but I do enjoy working on fullstack projects on the side.

### Current Project(s)

#### My personal website: fredriklund.se

I'm currently putting a lot of effort in building my own website completely from scratch which will include a custom built blog and portfolio.
