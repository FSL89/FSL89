## About Me
Self-taught full stack webdeveloper that have been building websites on and off the last 16+ years.

I started with HTML and CSS in the early 2000's and soon after learned basic PHP and MySQL, as I wanted to make my projects more dynamic.
This was long before video tutorials on Youtube, so I have to say that was quite an achievement by today's standards.

These days I mostly use Javascript for both backend and frontend, but really looking forward in learning other languages in the future.
